## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
I've wanted to know for a long time that the work or project that we have done has reached its goal and the only people who should receive compensation for doing the mission are those who have completed the mission, right? And are the owners of the project.  Really, but why was it so easily and easily changed hands even though that person had never done any missions or had never participated in any project at all, yet received a reward so easily?  And the people who did it did it so that other people could take away their work. If I could go back in time, I would never do something that undermined and destroyed me to this extent. Everything was hacked, but there was no ban or ban on those who hacked.  But somehow I only looked at the notification that that person or someone else had changed the project information.  The add-ons that were previously available were blocked, searches were blocked. In summary, I can only see if other people have hacked my work in the reporting section. Do I have to report every ID myself or not? If so.  That way, there wouldn't be any need for money.  As for the surveillance part, I'd like to ask if it's better to transfer money into your own account. What's wrong with that? Why does it have to be specified only in that country? I don't think it's the case when taxes are paid and no account is taken.  Who would dare to use it when there is no human verification of the report to determine whether it is true or false? Please review and see what I think is wrong.  Is it really mentioned?
